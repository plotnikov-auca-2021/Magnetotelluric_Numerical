This is temporary file which contains input data for different forward MT problem.
Later problem selection will be implemented inside the program.

First Problem:
sigma = np.array([0.1, 0.001])  # Conductivities (S/m)
h = np.array([100, inf])  # Layer thicknesses (m)

Second Problem:

sigma = np.array([0.0005, 0.05])  # Conductivities (S/m)
h = np.array([500, inf])  # Layer thicknesses (m)
